## [1.2.1](https://github.com/mod-posh/Xml2Doc/releases/tag/v1.2.1) - 2025-10-24

This release is a focused bugfix to clean up how nested generic types and parentheses render in Markdown, along with some related test and snapshot fixes. No new features ‚Äî just making the existing behavior finally *correct*.

## üêû Fixed

* **Trailing parentheses and braces**

  * Eliminated artifacts like `Int32)` and `XMember})` that appeared in method headers.
  * Signatures such as `Flatten(IEnumerable<IEnumerable<XItem>>)` now render with balanced angle brackets and no stray symbols.
* **Alias link formatting**

  * Fixed malformed reference links in alias lines ‚Äî e.g.
    `Alias that calls [Add(int, int)](...)` now renders cleanly without extra parentheses.
* **Section parsing during tests**

  * Updated `RenderSnapshots` section extraction logic to properly capture multi-level headings in single-file outputs.
  * Prevents cases where `# Mathx` or similar headings couldn‚Äôt be found or truncated early.
* **Cross-platform snapshot consistency**

  * Line endings and spacing normalized across all verified markdowns.
  * Reduces false diffs when running tests on Linux or Windows.
* **Snapshot seed refresh**

  * `snapshot_seed.ps1` updated to regenerate reference docs with corrected renderer output.

## üß© Internal

* Refined regex checks for generic parameter lists in `RenderSnapshots`.
* Cleaned up `MarkdownRenderer` short-name logic to remove lingering parentheses on primitive types.
* All snapshot tests (`Mathx`, `GenericPlayground`, `XItem`, and `index`) now pass consistently.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/mod-posh/Xml2Doc/releases/tag/v1.2.0) - 2025-10-24

### Added

* **Grouped Members Rendering** ‚Äî Members are now grouped by type (Methods, Properties, Events, etc.) for cleaner, more readable Markdown output.
* **Expanded Test Coverage** ‚Äî Introduced a dedicated test project validating Core, CLI, and MSBuild output end-to-end.
* **CLI Experience Enhancements** ‚Äî Added improved help text, descriptive flag output, and clearer validation for incorrect parameters.
* **Configuration Validation** ‚Äî The CLI and MSBuild integrations now validate config files and gracefully handle missing or invalid values.
* **Markdown Rendering Improvements** ‚Äî Better handling of `<typeparam>`, `<returns>`, and `<value>` elements, and more consistent formatting for parameter and return sections.
* **Improved Project Metadata** ‚Äî Added uniform tags, repository URLs, and license metadata across all `.csproj` files.
* **Per-Type vs Single-File Output Consistency** ‚Äî Both modes now share identical structure and styling rules for predictable output.
* **Enhanced Logging for MSBuild** ‚Äî Output now includes clear file paths and generation summaries.

### Changed

* Refactored renderer to separate type-level and member-level rendering.
* Standardized internal naming conventions across Core, CLI, and MSBuild projects.
* Updated CLI argument parsing and error handling for better consistency.
* Cleaned up namespace trimming and display logic for more readable type names.
* Snapshot tests updated to reflect grouped output and new formatting rules.

### Fixed

* Fixed incorrect handling of certain XML tags (`<value>`, `<typeparam>`, `<returns>`).
* Resolved path issues when working with nested namespaces and relative output paths.
* Corrected CLI config parsing where missing keys would previously throw errors.
* Fixed inconsistent Markdown spacing between type and member documentation blocks.

* New CLI option `--config` to load JSON configuration files.
* New CLI options `--file-names` and `--single` for flexible output modes.
* Added `RendererOptions` class with more granular configuration (filename mode, namespace trimming, language, etc.).

* Added new **MSBuild properties**:

  * `Xml2Doc_OutputDir`
  * `Xml2Doc_FileNameMode`
